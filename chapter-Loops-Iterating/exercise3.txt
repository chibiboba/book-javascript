The issue arose on line 3 when counter was assigned to 1 in the conditional part 
of the while loop. JavaScript accepts this code because the assignment always returns
a truthy value of 1. So the loop condition never becomes false. Even though there is a
counter += 1, at every iteration counter is reassigned back to 1.
