Exception handling is a process that deals with errors in a manageable and
preditictable manner. It uses the try/catch statement to catch exceptions that 
the code in the try block raises, and lets the programmer deal with the problem 
in a way that makes sense and perhaps prevents the entire application from crashing
or introducing subtle bugs.
