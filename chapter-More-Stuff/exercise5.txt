This function uses method chaining: : calling a method on the return value 
of another method. 
 

The split() method divides string into an ordered list of substrings,
puts these substrings into an array, and returns the array.  
The division is done by searching for a pattern,  where the pattern is provided 
as the first parameter in the method's call.  

The reverse() method reverses an array in place. The first array element becomes
the last, and the last array element becomes the first. 

Then the array uses .map() to iterate over each element. During each iteration, 
the element's length is returned. 

In summary, this code converts a string into an array of words, reverse that array,
and then returns a new array that contains thelengths of the words. It assumes that
a single space character delimits the words in the original string.
