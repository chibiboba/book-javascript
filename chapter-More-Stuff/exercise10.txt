The return value is the numeric value 6. 

If you apply ++ to a string, JavaScript coerces it to a number. So "5" was 
coerced to the number 5. Since y++ is the post-increment operator, it returns
the original value of y, not the incremented value. 

This shows that x++ is not the same thing as x = x + 1.
