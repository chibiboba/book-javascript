array1: 4. The length is the highest index position that has a value, plust 1. 
In this case, the highest index position has a value of 3: add 1 to that, to get
length of 4. 

array2: 5. You can set the length of an array. Even if the highest index position 
that has a value is assigned to 0, assigning a new length of 5 overrides that length and 
adds elements with a value of undefined to fill the gap. 

array3: 0. Index positions must be non-negative integers starting from 0. 

array4: 3. When you set an array to a length shorter than its current length, the array
gets truncated. 

array5: 101. The length is the highest index position that has a value, 
plus 1.
